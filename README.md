# Syteup

**Syteup** (a complete rewrite of [Syte](https://github.com/rigoneri/syte)) is a
really simple but powerful packaged personal site that has social integrations
like GitHub, Dribbble, Instagram, Tumblr, Wordpress,
Linkedin, Last.fm, SoundCloud, Bitbucket, StackOverflow, Flickr.
You can see it in action on [my personalsite](http://lejenome.github.io/).

## Social Integrations

### Blog

Syteup use [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com), [Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/)
or [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) for blogging and your blog will be the
primary page of the site.

### Social Services

Suteup currently support many different social services:
[Github](https://github.com/), [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/),
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/), [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/),
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/),

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/),...

Some other services integration is planed. For more up to date list of currently
supported services and planed services isavailable on
[TODO.md](https://github.com/lejenome/syteup/tree/master/TODO.md) file.

NOTE: Some services can not be supported as accessing them from client side will
give crackers full access to your account (e.g: Twitter, Foursquare) or the service provider does not support
server side requirements (e.g: neither SOP nor jsonp are supported by Steam,...),
if you want them to be implemented, ask the service provider to supported limited
permission access tokens or other needed requirements.

## Installation

Syteup dose not require  any specific server side future as it is server-less
moder HTML5 webapp.

```

[dist/](https://github.com/lejenome/syteup/blob/master/dist/)
